Problem statement
Aryan and his friends are very fond of patterns. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the Reverse Letter Triangle.

You must print a matrix corresponding to the given Reverse Letter Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

A B C
A B
A

Code:
public class Solution {
    public static void nLetterTriangle(int n) {
	    for (int i=n-1; i>=0; i--){
            for(char ch= 'A'; ch<= 'A'+i; ch++){
                System.out.print(ch+" ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
