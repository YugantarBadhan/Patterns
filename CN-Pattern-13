Aryan and his friends are very fond of patterns. For a given integer ‘N’, they want to make the Increasing Number Triangle.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 

1
2 3
4 5 6

Code:
public class Solution {
    public static void nNumberTriangle(int n) {
        int number=1;
        for(int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            for (int j=1; j<=i; j++){
                System.out.print(number+" ");
                number++;
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
