Problem statement
Sam is curious about Alpha-Ramp, so he decided to create Alpha-Ramp of different sizes.

An Alpha-Ramp is represented by a triangle, where alphabets are filled from the top in order.

For every value of ‘N’, help sam to return the corresponding Alpha-Ramp.

Example:
Input: ‘N’ = 3

Output: 
A
B B
C C C

Code:
public class Solution {
    public static void alphaRamp(int n) {
        char count='A';
	    for (int i=1; i<=n; i++){
            for(char ch= 'A'; ch<= count; ch++){
                System.out.print(count+" ");
            }
            System.out.println();
            count++;
        }
    }
}
